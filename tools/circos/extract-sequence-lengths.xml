Extract sequence lengths from the Galaxy length sets, into a file for you to use with Circos.

This is required because the lengths files in Galaxy often contain small fragments which may be relevant for analysis, but are not relevant during visualisation. We could not identify a uniform way of extracting this which would generate uniformly correct and useful results. So we provide this tool, and you can filter your length files as needed with normal Galaxy tools.
