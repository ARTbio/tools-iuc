**What it does**

DiffBind_ is a `Bioconductor package`_ that provides functions for processing ChIP-Seq data enriched for genomic loci where specific
protein/DNA binding occurs, including peak sets identified by ChIP-Seq peak callers and
aligned sequence read datasets. It is designed to work with multiple peak sets simultaneously,
representing different ChIP experiments (antibodies, transcription factor and/or histone
marks, experimental conditions, replicates) as well as managing the results of multiple peak
callers.

The primary emphasis of DiffBind is on identifying sites that are differentially bound
between two sample groups. It includes functions to support the processing of peak sets,
including overlapping and merging peak sets, counting sequencing reads overlapping intervals
in peak sets, and identifying statistically significantly differentially bound sites based on
evidence of binding affinity (measured by differences in read densities). To this end it uses
statistical routines developed in an RNA-Seq context (primarily the Bioconductor packages
edgeR and DESeq2). Additionally, the package builds on Rgraphics routines to provide a
set of standardized plots to aid in binding analysis.

The `DiffBind User Guide`_ includes a brief overview of the processing flow, followed by four sections of
examples: the first focusing on the core task of obtaining differentially bound sites based on
affinity data, the second working through the main plotting routines, the third discussing the
use of a blocking factor, and the fourth revisiting occupancy data (peak calls) in more detail,
as well as comparing the results of an occupancy-based analysis with an affinity-based one.
Finally, certain technical aspects of the how these analyses are accomplished are detailed.

Note DiffBind requires a minimum of four samples (two groups with two replicates each).

**Inputs**

DiffBind works primarily with peaksets, which are sets of genomic intervals representing
candidate protein binding sites. Each interval consists of a chromosome, a start and end
position, and usually a score of some type indicating confidence in, or strength of, the peak.
Associated with each peakset are metadata relating to the experiment from which the peakset
was derived. Additionally, files containing mapped sequencing reads (generally .bam files) can
be associated with each peakset (one for the ChIP data, and optionally another representing
a control sample)

differential analysis.

**More Information**

Generally, processing data with DiffBind involves five phases:

 #. Reading in peaksets
 #. Occupancy analysis
 #. Counting reads
 #. Differential binding affinity analysis
 #. Plotting and reporting


**Reading in peaksets**:

The first step is to read in a set of peaksets and associated
metadata. Peaksets are derived either from ChIP-Seq peak callers, such as **MACS2**, or using some other criterion (e.g. genomic windows, or all the promoter regions
in a genome).  A single experiment can have more than
one associated peakset; e.g. if multiple peak callers are used for comparison purposes
each sample would have more than one line in the sample sheet. Once the peaksets
are read in, a merging function finds all overlapping peaks and derives a single set of
unique genomic intervals covering all the supplied peaks (a consensus peakset for the
experiment).

**Occupancy analysis**:

Peaksets, especially those generated by peak callers, provide
an insight into the potential occupancy of the protein being ChIPed for at specific
genomic loci. After the peaksets have been loaded, it can be useful to perform some
exploratory plotting to determine how these occupancy maps agree with each other,
e.g. between experimental replicates (re-doing the ChIP under the same conditions),
between different peak callers on the same experiment, and within groups of samples
representing a common experimental condition. DiffBind provides functions to enable
overlaps to be examined, as well as functions to determine how well similar samples
cluster together. Beyond quality control, the product of an occupancy analysis may be
a consensus peakset, representing an overall set of candidate binding sites to be used
in further analysis.

**Counting reads**:

Once a consensus peakset has been derived, DiffBind can use the
supplied sequence read files to count how many reads overlap each interval for each
unique sample. The peaks in the consensus peakset may be re-centered and trimmed
based on calculating their summits (point of greatest read overlap) in order to provide
more standardized peak intervals. The final result of counting is a binding affinity matrix
containing a (normalized) read count for each sample at every potential binding site.
With this matrix, the samples can be re-clustered using affinity, rather than occupancy,
data. The binding affinity matrix is used for QC plotting as well as for subsequent
differential analysis.

**Differential binding affinity analysis**:

The core functionality of DiffBind is the
differential binding affinity analysis, which enables binding sites to be identified that
are statistically significantly differentially bound between sample groups. To accomplish
this, first a contrast (or contrasts) is established, dividing the samples into groups to
be compared. Next the core analysis routines are executed, by default using DESeq2 .
This will assign a p-value and FDR to each candidate binding site indicating confidence
that they are differentially bound.

**Plotting and reporting**:

Once one or more contrasts have been run, DiffBind provides
a number of functions for reporting and plotting the results. MA plots give an
overview of the results of the analysis, while correlation heatmaps and PCA plots show
how the groups cluster based on differentially bound sites. Boxplots show the distribution
of reads within differentially bound sites corresponding to whether they gain or
lose affinity between the two sample groups. A reporting mechanism enables differentially
bound sites to be extracted for further processing, such as annotation, motif, and
pathway analyses. *Note that currently only the correlation plot is implemented in this Galaxy tool.*
