Similar to ErmC Expression of ErmA is inducible by erythromycin. The leader peptide causes attenuation of the mRNA and stabilizes the structure preventing further translation. When erythromycin is present it binds the leader peptide causing a change in conformation allowing for the expression of ErmA.
