        This program filters the alignment file produced by nucmer, leaving only the desired alignments. Its primary function is the LIS algorithm which calculates the longest increasing subset of alignments. This allows for the calculation of a global set of alignments (i.e. 1-to-1 and mutually consistent order) with the 1-1 global option or locally consistent with 1-1 with rearrangements or many-to-many alingment. Reference sequences can be mapped to query sequences with the reference option of the Overlaps parameter, or queries to references with the Query option. This allows the user to exclude chance and repeat induced alignments, leaving only the "best" alignments between the two data sets. Filtering can also be performed on length, identity, and uniquenes.

        An important distinction between the alignment options is that 1-1 global requires the alignments to be mutually consistent in their order, while the other options are not required to be mutually consistent and therefore tolerate translocations, inversions, etc.

        In general cases, the many-to-many option is the best choice, however 1-1 alignment allowing for rearrangements can be handy for applications such as SNP finding which require a 1-to-1 mapping. 

        Finally, for mapping query contigs, or sequencing reads, to a reference genome, use the query option for the Overlaps parameter.
