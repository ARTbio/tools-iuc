**What it does**

By far, the most common question asked of two sets of genomic features is whether or not any of the
features in the two sets &quot;overlap&quot; with one another. This is known as feature intersection. intersectBed
allows one to screen for overlaps between two sets of genomic features. Moreover, it allows one to have
fine control as to how the intersections are reported. intersectBed works with both BED/GFF
and BAM files as input.

By default, if an overlap is found, intersectBed reports the shared interval between the two
overlapping features.


**Default behavior when using BAM input**

When comparing alignments in BAM format to features in BED format, intersectBed
will, by default, write the output in BAM format. That is, each alignment in the BAM file that meets
the user's criteria will be written in BAM format. This serves as a mechanism to
create subsets of BAM alignments are of biological interest, etc. Note that only the mate in the BAM
alignment is compared to the BED file. Thus, if only one end of a paired-end sequence overlaps with a
feature in B, then that end will be written to the BAM output. By contrast, the other mate for the
pair will not be written. One should use pairToBed if one wants each BAM alignment
for a pair to be written to BAM output.


**Output BED format when using BAM input**

When comparing alignments in BAM format to features in BED format, intersectBed
will optionally write the output in BED format. That is, each alignment in the BAM file is converted
to a 6 column BED feature and if overlaps are found (or not) based on the user's criteria, the BAM
alignment will be reported in BED format. The BED &quot;name&quot; field is comprised of the RNAME field in
the BAM alignment. If mate information is available, the mate (e.g., &quot;/1&quot; or &quot;/2&quot;) field will be
appended to the name. The &quot;score&quot; field is the mapping quality score from the BAM alignment.
